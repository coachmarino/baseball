    "\n",
    "The National Baseball Hall of Fame is an independent, non-profit institution dedicated to the history of the game of baseball.  Besides being a general repository for baseball history, the Hall also enshrines players who've had exceptional careers or have otherwise significantly impacted the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hall of Fame players are selected through a subjective process (voting).  In considering the career of a prospective player, voters must differentiate the career of that player from other players eligible for induction.  Statistical summaries of a player's career can be a starting point for these comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are no given stastical rules to determine hall of fame induction, each individual voter may consider different statistical factors.  Through an analysis of the statistics of available player statistics, it's possible to determine the statistical categories most likely to influence a voter's decision to choose one player over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document explores the batting statistics that may play the greatest role in determining whether or not a player will be voted into the hall of fame.\n",

    "\n",
    "The <i>Batting Title</i> award each year goes to the player who has the highest <b>Batting Average</b>, so it is hypothesized that is likely to be a significant factor, if not <i>the</i> most significant statistic.  It is also expected that <b>Home Runs</b> will be a very significant factor, based on the significance of being a leader in that realm throughout history.  It is also expected that the correlations may vary over time based on a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in the ball or bat, changes in the tactics employed by managers, or perceptions of voters based on charatcer or social issues.\n",

    "While all analyzed batting statistics are positively correlated with Hall of Fame selection, the categories with the strongest correlation are <b>Runs, RBI, </b>and <b>Hits</b>.  <b>Batting Average</b> and <b>Home Runs</b> were actually among the batting categories with the weakest correlation to Hall of Fame selection.  There is a demonstrable fluctuation for some statistical categories and their correlation with Hall of Fame selection based on the era in which players played."

    "<b>Limitations</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a superficial explanation of the statistics as numbers.  The game of baseball, however, is played by humans, and most importantly, Hall of Fame voting is also done by humans.  Each voter brings in their own personalities, values, and bias to the table when voting.  The analysis in this project is objective, but the voting process is subjective.  Additional limitations of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Pitchers and batting statistics</i> - Pitchers generally do not accumulate volumes of batting statistics, so they were eliminated from the final analysis.  At least one former pitcher was elected to the Hall of Fame also possessing, what would be considered by this analysis, significant batting statistics:  Babe Ruth.  While Babe Ruth is well known, others may not be as well known, so it would take some additional analysis to include these players, perhaps on an individual basis.  The lack of a player as significant as Babe Ruth in the hall of fame table may skew the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Changes to Rules</i> - Throughout the history of baseball there have been rules changes that may have affected the statistics of given players, such as the addition of the <i>Designated Hitter</i> who is an offensive specialist with no defensive responsibilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Changes to/Differences in Equipment, Playing Surfaces, Stadiums</i> - Equipment like bats and balls may have been changed over the course of history.  Synthetic surfaces may react differently to bouncing balls than natural turf.  Smaller or larger stadiums may influence the amount of home runs.  Players playing in different climates more often may have advantages over others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Changes to Players, Training/Nutrition/Supplement Regimines</i> - Modern players may pay more close attention to weight training, giving them more power, perhaps resulting in more home runs or harder hit balls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Ineligible Players, Cheating and Suspicions of Cheating</i> - The analysis demonstrates that <b>Home Runs</b> and Total <b>Hits</b> are both significantly correlated to Hall of Fame selection.  In both instances, the career leaders in these categorie are not in the Hall of Fame.  Pete Rose is career leader in Hits, but is not in the Hall of Fame.  Barry Bonds is the career Home Runs leader, but he is also not in the hall of fame.  And while these are obvious examples of anomolies, there maybe less obvious examples of players that may have batting statistics similar to players in the Hall of Fame, who have not been inducted, for reasons other than baseball achievement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Team Success</i> - Baseball is a team game, and team success may play a part in Hall of Fame consideration, but also in how well a player performs.  It is conceivable that a team's success could increase a player's profile in a subjective voting process, and the inverse is also conceivable.  Additionally, playing alongside other successful players could impact statistics.  For example, a strong team will have fewer 'outs,' allowing a batter to get more <b>At-Bats</b>, which this alaysis has demonstrated to be significant factor in hall of fame selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Significant Correlation Between Statistical Categories</i> - It is difficult to put a spotlight on individual batting statitical categories without speaking about success in others.  This statistical analysis demonstrates a significant correlation between many of the statistical categories.  In some ways they are 'joined at the hip.'  \n",
    "\n",
    "In many of the above instances of limitations, a potential correction is the analysis of different defined thirty-year eras.  These eras, however, were arbitrarily defined, and were not specifically chosen to correct for any particular challenge of the analysis."

    "<b>Findings</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Significance of Statistical Categories</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a confidence level of 95% (default interval of modules), each of the selected categories considered by the analysis has a significant positive correlation to Hall of Fame Selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the categories demonstrating strongest positive correlation, <b>Runs</b> (r = 0.531) is the strongest in the overall analysis.  The next two categories in terms of strength of correlation is <b>RBI</b> (r = 0.516) and <b>Hits</b> (r = 0.515).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the positive correlation remains significant, neither of the categories hypothesized to be the most significant measured to be so.  In fact, not only is <b>Batting Average</b> one of the least significant categories studied by this project, it is one of the least significant factors for each of the era's analyzed.  For players of the earliest era (who retired prior to 1900), the correlation very nearly lacks significance (r = 0.195, p-value = 0.143, N = 58, which may not be a large enough population for a reliable p-value calculation).  The significance of the positive correlation during the most recent era (players who retired between 1990 and 2010) is strong, but the correlation itself (r = .252) is again the smallest measured of the categories considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Home Runs</b> (r = 0.359), while having a significant positive correlation with Hall of Fame status, is still among the lower correlated statistics.  Unlike Batting Average, Home Runs is a statistic that has been more significant in certain eras than in others.  It was among the top statistics for players retiring prior to 1900 (r = 0.555) as well as between 1960 and 1990 (r = 0.560).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Changes over Time</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated with the <b>Home Run</b> category above, certain statistical categories have varied in significance over time, in their ability to determine Hall of Fame status.  <b>Stolen Bases</b> is a good example of a statistic that was among the more significant categories over one era (players retiring between 1900 and 1930, r = 0.433), yet overall is the least correlated category considered in this analysis (r = 0.276).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall correlation of all statistics varies over time (figure v7) suggesting that other factors outside of this analysis may have had a relatively higher correlation with Hall of Fame induction during certain eras (e.g, defensive performance, team performance, or character rationale).\n"

    "<b>Implications and Observations</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Though correlation does not equal causation, it can be implied from the analysis that batting average may not be as significant a statistic as generally accepted, given that the yearly <i>Batting Champion</i> award is given to the player with the highest Batting Average.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Batting Average as a statistic is not as multidimensional as Runs.  Scoring a run can involve hitting a home run, or it can involve taking a walk (BB) and stealing a base to get into a better scoring position.  RBI is also a statistic that is multidimensional, as a player can earn an RBI with a walk or a sacrifice fly, neither of which is a hit.  The correlation of these statistics with one another is significant and demonstrated by the analysis in this project.  Batting average is one of the categories that is not as significantly correlated with the others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Eligibility requirements also affect the overall analysis.  In order to be eligible for hall of fame voting, a player has to have appeared in games over ten different years.  It can be assumed that a player will not be able to play for ten years without having success.  The standard deviation for the Batting Average stat is very low, so for this population of baseball players, there is a smaller degree of separation between those that have a high enough batting average to qualify for hall of fame acceptance and those who don't, but are still good enough to stay in the game for ten years.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to the plots in v8 above, the difference between the mean Batting Average for each population is relatively narrow, when compared to the differences observed in the same evalations of the Runs, RBI or Hits categories, likely resulting in a lower correlation with Hall of Fame selection compared to the other categories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Runs, RBI and Hits are cumulative statistics.  Given two players of similar ability, and similar batting average, yet one retiring early due to injury, while the other plays twenty years, the player who plays for a longer period is likely to acquire far more Runs, RBI, and Hits over that time period.  Given a significant difference in years played, the difference in statistics is likely to stand out to a voter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Runs is a more complex conversation that likely involves the attitudes of voters about the statistic as much as it does the increase in mean Home Runs over time.  For example, a time period that features walls closer to the field and tighter wound balls would affect the increase in mean.  Players taking peformance enhancing drugs, resulting in greater power and more home runs may artificially affect the statistic, particularly if suspicion of drug use causes voters pause in voting.  Two of the hitters with a large number of home runs, Babe Ruth and Barry Bonds, and the greatest number of home runs in their era are not included in the analysis.  That could affect the correlation of the statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots in v8 for the Home Runs category demonstrates the severe fluctuation in that category in terms of the rate that Hall of Fame players outperformed their contemporaries, which combined with the factors discussed may have completely altered the way in which the category is viewed by voters in succeeding eras.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to rules, equipment, player nutrition, and social issues, among other factors, can all influence a subjective vote, so it is not surprising that the correlation of these statistical categories fluctuated over time.  Stolen Bases in particular was a statistic that saw some prominence in certain eras.  This fluctuation may be explained by evolving changes in how the game is played, as in successful managers choosing to avoid stealing bases because of the risk of losing base runners and run scoring opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, however, all of the statistical categories in this analysis showed statistically significant positive correlation with Hall of Fame selection.  Just as all of these categories show significant correlation with one another, it is likely that the voting process takes a large number of career statistics into play rather than just a select few.\n",
